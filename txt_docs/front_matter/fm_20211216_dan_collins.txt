                 Since I got my start in IT over twenty years ago in 2000, the field has evolved; with                             
                 different trends finding focus.  Now the focus is on trends like the cloud, AI, and      
                 ways to enable safe and secure collaboration among distributed participants in networked,                                                                                     virtual workspaces.  My interests are containerization, system automation, algorithms  
                 for efficient and productive collaboration, and 'data science' so-called.  As someone  
                 who has proficiency in a second language, I also seek to put to good use my capacity         
                 to communicate in Japanese: while AI has lowered language barriers, communication     
                 is more than competently translated words and phrases: communication, especially when    
                 it is difficult, is about negotiation--working to bridge the gap between clashing      
                 sets of values--something which, depending on the situation, may not be possible and/or  
                 desirable(*).
