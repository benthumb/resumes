               Since I got my start in IT over twenty years ago in 2000, the field has evolved; with
               different trends finding focus.  Now the focus is on trends like the cloud, AI, and
               ways to enable safe and secure collaboration among distributed participants in networked,
               virtual workspaces.  My interests are containerization, system automation, algorithms
               for efficient and productive collaboration, and 'data science' so-called.  As someone
               who has proficiency in a second language, I also seek to put to good use my capacity
               to communicate in Japanese: while AI has lowered language barriers, communication
               is more than competently translated words and phrases: communication, especially when
               it is difficult, is about negotiation--working to bridge the gap between clashing
               sets of values--something which, depending on the situation, may not be possible and/or
               desirable.
